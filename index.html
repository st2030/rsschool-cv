<h2>Code Examples</h2>
"<b>Sum of odd numbers</b>" task (kata) at CodeWars:

<pre>
<b>Task description:</b>
Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
   13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
...
Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) e.g.: (Input --> Output)
1 -->  1
2 --> 3 + 5 = 8
</pre>

<b>Task solution using PHP:</b>
<pre>
function rowSumOddNumbers($n) {
    $num = 0;
    for ($i = $n; $i > 0; $i--) {
        $num += $i;
    }
    $sum = $num**2 - ($num - $n)**2;
    return $sum;
}

"<b>Boiled eggs</b>" task (kata) at CodeWars:

<b>Task description:</b>
<pre>
You are the greatest chef on earth. No one boils eggs like you! Your restaurant is always full of guests, who love your boiled eggs. But when there is a greater order of boiled eggs, you need some time, because you have only one pot for your job. How much time do you need?
Your Task

Implement a function, which takes a non-negative integer, representing the number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (integer), which it takes to have all the eggs boiled.
Rules

    you can put at most 8 eggs into the pot at once
    it takes 5 minutes to boil an egg
    we assume, that the water is boiling all the time (no time to heat up)
    for simplicity we also don't consider the time it takes to put eggs into the pot or get them out of it

Example (Input --> Output)
0 --> 0
5 --> 5
10 --> 10
</pre>

<b>Task solution using PHP:</b>
<pre>
function cooking_time(int $eggs): int {
   $cooking_time = 0;
   if ($eggs == 0) {
      return 0;
   }
   elseif ($eggs > 8) {
         $cook_main=intdiv($eggs, 8);
         if ($eggs % 8 > 0) {$cook_extra = 5;
         $cooking_time = $cook_main*5 + $cook_extra;}
         else $cooking_time = $cook_main*5;
         return $cooking_time;
      }
   else {
         $cooking_time = 5;
         return $cooking_time;
   }
}
