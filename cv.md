## ***About Me***
---
Successful technical translator with over 16 years of professional experience in the oil & gas industry, and with about 7 years of engineering experience as a QC engineer in construction projects, oil&gas production engineer, and oil field development supervisor in the same industry. Currently working as a freelance technical translator providing services for international oil and gas projects. Planning to relaunch my career in IT as a programmer. In process of pursuing the Bachelor of Computer Science degree at the University of the People. Being an intrinsically motivated person and having good critical thinking skills I am capable of quick learning and improving relevant skills to reach the assigned objectives and resolve work tasks within a limited time frame. My short-term goal is to re-start a career as a front-end developer. My long-term goal is to be involved as a programmer in Natural Languages Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Robotic Engineering projects.
